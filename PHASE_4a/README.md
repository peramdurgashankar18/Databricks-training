# 🚀 PHASE-4A – Bucketing & Segmentation in PySpark

> **Transforming continuous numerical data into meaningful customer segments using PySpark!** 📊✨

This phase focuses on understanding **Bucketing and Customer Segmentation**, two important concepts in data engineering and business analytics. Different segmentation techniques are implemented using PySpark and SQL to categorize customers based on their spending behavior and compare multiple analytical approaches.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this phase is to learn how continuous numerical values can be converted into meaningful business categories using different bucketing and customer segmentation techniques.

This project includes:

* 📥 Data Preparation
* 🧹 Data Cleaning
* 💰 Customer Spend Analysis
* 🥇 Customer Segmentation
* 📊 Customer Distribution Analysis
* 📈 Quantile-Based Segmentation
* 🪣 MLlib Bucketizer
* 🏆 Window-Based Ranking

---

## 📊 Dataset Used

The project uses sample datasets from Spark Playground.

### 👥 customers.csv

Contains customer information such as:

* Customer ID
* First Name
* Last Name
* City

### 💰 sales.csv

Contains sales transaction details including:

* Customer ID
* Order Date
* Total Amount

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Performed

Before performing segmentation, the following preprocessing steps were completed:

* ✅ Removed rows with missing `customer_id`
* ✅ Removed duplicate records
* ✅ Converted `total_amount` from String to Double
* ✅ Filtered records with negative sales values

---

## 📈 Practice Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1 – Customer Segmentation (Conditional Logic)

Created Gold, Silver, and Bronze customer segments using `when()` and `otherwise()`.

| Segment   | Condition                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 🥇 Gold   | Total Spend > 10000                |
| 🥈 Silver | Total Spend between 5000 and 10000 |
| 🥉 Bronze | Total Spend < 5000                 |

---

### ✅ Task 2 – Customer Count by Segment

Grouped customers based on their segment and calculated the number of customers in each category.

**Output**

* Segment
* Customer Count

---

### ✅ Task 3 – Quantile-Based Segmentation

Used `approxQuantile()` to divide customers into balanced groups based on their spending distribution.

This approach creates customer segments based on the actual distribution of spending values instead of using fixed business thresholds.

---

### ✅ Task 4 – Bucketizer (MLlib)

Applied Spark MLlib's `Bucketizer` to convert continuous spending values into predefined numerical buckets.

Bucketizer helps transform continuous numerical features into categorical ranges that can be used for analytics and machine learning workflows.

---

### ✅ Task 5 – Window-Based Ranking

Ranked customers according to their total spending using the `percent_rank()` Window Function.

This method helps identify the relative spending position of each customer compared with other customers.
